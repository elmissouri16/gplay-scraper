## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
from gplay_scraper import GPlayScraper

scraper = GPlayScraper()

# App Methods
app_info = scraper.app_get_fields("com.whatsapp", ["title", "score", "installs"])
print(f"{app_info['title']} ‚Äî {app_info['score']}‚òÖ ‚Äî {app_info['installs']} installs")

# Search Methods
search_results = scraper.search_get_fields("fitness tracker", ["title", "developer"], count=20)
for app in search_results[:3]:
    print(f"{app['title']} by {app['developer']}")

# Reviews Methods
reviews = scraper.reviews_get_fields("com.whatsapp", ["userName", "score"], count=100, sort="NEWEST")
print(f"Latest reviewer: {reviews[0]['userName']} rated {reviews[0]['score']}‚òÖ")

# Developer Methods
portfolio = scraper.developer_get_fields("5700313618786177705", ["title", "score"], count=50)
print(f"Developer apps tracked: {len(portfolio)}")

# List Methods
top_free = scraper.list_get_fields("TOP_FREE", "GAME", ["title", "score"], count=50)
print(f"Top game: {top_free[0]['title']} ({top_free[0]['score']}‚òÖ)")

# Similar Methods
competitors = scraper.similar_get_fields("com.whatsapp", ["title", "score"], count=30)
print(f"Similar app example: {competitors[0]['title']} ({competitors[0]['score']}‚òÖ)")

# Suggest Methods
suggestions = scraper.suggest_nested("photo editor", count=10)
print(f"Related suggestions: {list(suggestions.keys())[:3]}")
```

## üìñ Method Pattern

Each method type exposes three data-retrieval helpers:

- **`analyze()`** - Get all data as dictionary/list
- **`get_field()`** - Get single field value
- **`get_fields()`** - Get multiple fields as dictionary

Suggest methods additionally expose `nested()` for secondary suggestions.

## üåç Multi-Language & Multi-Region

All methods support multi-language and multi-region parameters:

```python
# Get data in Spanish from Spain
scraper.app_analyze("com.whatsapp", lang="es", country="es")

# Get data in Japanese from Japan
scraper.search_analyze("game", count=20, lang="ja", country="jp")

# Get data in French from France
scraper.reviews_analyze("com.whatsapp", count=50, lang="fr", country="fr")
```

**Supported:**
- **Languages:** 100+ (en, es, fr, de, ja, ko, zh, ar, pt, ru, etc.)
- **Countries:** 150+ (us, gb, ca, au, in, br, jp, kr, de, fr, etc.)

## üîß HTTP Client

GPlay Scraper now relies exclusively on [`curl_cffi`](https://github.com/yifeikong/curl_cffi) with built-in Chrome impersonation. Initialising `GPlayScraper()` without arguments uses this client automatically; there is no override parameter for alternate HTTP clients.
