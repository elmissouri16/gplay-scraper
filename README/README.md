## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
from gplay_scraper import GPlayScraper

scraper = GPlayScraper()

# App Methods
scraper.app_print_fields("com.whatsapp", ["title", "score", "installs"])

# Search Methods
scraper.search_print_fields("fitness tracker", ["title", "developer"], count=20)

# Reviews Methods
scraper.reviews_print_fields("com.whatsapp", ["userName", "score"], count=100, sort="NEWEST")

# Developer Methods
scraper.developer_print_fields("5700313618786177705", ["title", "score"], count=50)

# List Methods
scraper.list_print_fields("TOP_FREE", "GAME", ["title", "score"], count=50)

# Similar Methods
scraper.similar_print_fields("com.whatsapp", ["title", "score"], count=30)

# Suggest Methods
scraper.suggest_print_nested("photo editor", count=10)
```

## üìñ Method Pattern

Each method type follows the same pattern with 5 functions:

- **`analyze()`** - Get all data as dictionary/list
- **`get_field()`** - Get single field value
- **`get_fields()`** - Get multiple fields as dictionary
- **`print_field()`** - Print single field to console
- **`print_fields()`** - Print multiple fields to console
Suggest methods additionally expose `nested()` / `print_nested()`.

## üåç Multi-Language & Multi-Region

All methods support multi-language and multi-region parameters:

```python
# Get data in Spanish from Spain
scraper.app_analyze("com.whatsapp", lang="es", country="es")

# Get data in Japanese from Japan
scraper.search_analyze("game", count=20, lang="ja", country="jp")

# Get data in French from France
scraper.reviews_analyze("com.whatsapp", count=50, lang="fr", country="fr")
```

**Supported:**
- **Languages:** 100+ (en, es, fr, de, ja, ko, zh, ar, pt, ru, etc.)
- **Countries:** 150+ (us, gb, ca, au, in, br, jp, kr, de, fr, etc.)

## üîß HTTP Client

GPlay Scraper now relies exclusively on [`curl_cffi`](https://github.com/yifeikong/curl_cffi) with built-in Chrome impersonation. Initialising `GPlayScraper()` without arguments uses this client automatically; there is no override parameter for alternate HTTP clients.
